#### Learning

##### Problem arising from deployment in open-set conditions

- Uncertainty Estimation

reliably estimate the uncertainty in predictions

​		- Bayesian techniques

​		- Calibration techniques

​		- Bayesian deep learning

​		- Ensemble methods

- Identify Unknowns

  closed-set conditions -> open-set conditions
