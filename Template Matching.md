Template Matching



The different between statistical-learning techniques and template matching is that statistical-learning techniques aim at detection unseen objects from certain object classes instead of detecting a priori known object instances from mutiple viewpoints.

The templates is found in the image by computing the similarity between the template and the image for all relevant pose of the template.

the question is:

- The ways of similarity defined?

- How to compute the similarity?

  

The goal of template matching:

- robust recognition algorithm for finding a **particular** type of object.
- A method to find a any kind of object that can be configured simply by showing the system a prototype of the calss of objects.
