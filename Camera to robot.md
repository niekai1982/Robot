## Camera to robot



Camer pose estimation and camera to robot calibration?

The problem of camera pose estimation called space resection

Camera pose estimation is closely related to pose estimation, but is more general as the calibration simulaneously estimates both pose and the intrinsic parameters of the camera.



Given a calibrated camera at C and n correspondences between 3D reference points $P_i$ and their images $u_i$, each pair of Correspondence $P_i \ u_i$
