Machine Perception



Research in machine perception tackles the hard problems of understanding images, sounds, music and video. In recent years, our computers have become much better at such tasks, enabling a variety of new applications such as: content-based search in Google Photos and Image Search, natural [handwriting](https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/04/google-handwriting-input-in-82.html) interfaces for Android, [optical character recognition](https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/05/paper-to-digital-in-200-languages.html) for Google Drive documents, and recommendation systems that understand music and YouTube videos. Our approach is driven by algorithms that benefit from processing very large, partially-labeled datasets using parallel computing clusters. A good example is our recent work on object recognition using a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture known as [Inception](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43022.html) that achieves state-of-the-art results on academic benchmarks and allows users to easily search through their large collection of Google Photos. The ability to mine meaningful information from multimedia is broadly applied throughout Google.

#### Georgia Institute of Technology

Georgia Tech, School of Interactive Computing,Robotics & Computational Perception



Robotics and computational perception research at Georgia Tech runs from engineering to machine learning, from locomotion to autonomous ethical behavior in robotic machines. Our work is focused in two of our research centers and labs: The Robotics and Intelligent Machines (RIM) Center at Georgia Tech and the Computational Perception Lab (CPL).

RIM leverages the Institute’s strengths and resources by reaching across traditional boundaries to embrace a multidisciplinary approach. The College of Computing, College of Engineering and the Georgia Tech Research Institute play key, complementary roles through Tech's traditional expertise in interactive and intelligent computing, control and mechanical engineering. Emphasizing personal and everyday robotics, as well as the future of automation, RIM faculty help students understand and define the future role of robotics in society.

CPL was developed to explore and develop the next generation of intelligent machines, interfaces and environments for modeling, perceiving, recognizing, and interacting with humans. CPL domains of interest include computer vision/perception, computer graphics, computer animation, human-computer interaction, digital special effects, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, machine learning, robotics, aware home/environments, audio processing, ubiquitous computing/sensing, eldercare technologies, motion analysis, and computational music.
