#### Definition

- In **modern linear algebra**, it refers to linear mapping(线性映射) from a vector space V into its field of scalers, i.e., it refers to an element of the dual space $V^*$
- In **mathmatical analysis**, more generally and historically, it regers to a mapping from a space X into the real numbers, or sometimes into the complex numverss, for the purpose of establishing a calculus-like structure on X.Depending on the author such mappings mays or may not be assumed to be linear, or to be defined on the whole space X.
- In **computer science**, it is synonymous(同意的) with hight-order functions, i.e. functions that take functions as arguments or return them.

The space X is a space of functions, which is not mathematically essential, so this older definition is no longer prevalent(流行).

The term of originates from the **calculus of variations**, where one **searches for a function** that **minimizes**(or maximizes) a **given functional**.

Functional， 指以**函数**构成的向量空间为定义域， **实数为值域的函数**，即某一个依赖于其它一个或者几个函数确定其值的量，往往称为函数的函数(function of function, functional *as a noun*)。==在物理学上，寻找某个能量泛函的最小系统状态是泛函的一个重要应用。==a particulars important application in physics is seach for a state of system that minimizes the action.

>  重点：函数为定义域，实数为值域，向量空间到标量域的映射

##### Duality

The mapping $x_0 \mapsto f(x_0)$ is a function, where $x_0$ is an argument of function $f$.

At the same time, the mapping of a function to the value of the function at point $f \mapsto f(x_0)$ is a functional; here $x_0$ is a parameter.
